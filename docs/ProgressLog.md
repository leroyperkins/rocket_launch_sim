Created base-repo for all of my code and to organize important documents, code
and everything else to keep my repo nice and organized. Everything is subject to 
change.

Also, went through and made a large overview and breakdown of how I am going to 
progress through this project. Milestones, objectives, making sure I am understanding
why I am doing the things I am doing -- and knowing how it all connects. Aiming to 
learn as I go and apply many different techniques to one goal. 

Got a list of all of my hardware that I have. Sensors, servos, small motors, nucleo board
and 3D printer. Focusing on making it all manageable to take on and do in small chunks.
